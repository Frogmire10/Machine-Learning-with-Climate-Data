ClimateWins: Machine Learning for Weather Conditions and Climate Change

Overview
ClimateWins is a European nonprofit organization focused on predicting the impacts of climate change across Europe using machine learning techniques. This project applies various machine learning algorithms to analyze historical weather data and predict future climate conditions, such as rising temperatures and extreme weather events.

By leveraging supervised and unsupervised learning methods, this project aims to build accurate models that can assist in predicting weather patterns and provide actionable insights into the potential future consequences of climate change.

Key Objectives
Utilise machine learning models to predict rising daily temperatures in Europe over the coming years.
Analyse and compare the accuracy of supervised vs. unsupervised learning approaches for weather condition prediction.
Develop models capable of forecasting extreme weather conditions, such as droughts and extreme winter spells.

Project Highlights
Data Source: Weather data from 18 European weather stations (spanning from the 1800s to 2022) is used to train the machine learning models.
Machine Learning Techniques: The project applies K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Decision Trees for predicting weather outcomes.
Optimisation: Gradient descent is used to optimize model accuracy and reduce error in predictions.
Evaluation: The models are evaluated based on accuracy and performance using metrics like confusion matrices and loss functions.
